## About 🚀

The website has 4 pages. On the first, Home page, you 
have cool typing animation on Desktops whilst on mobile 
phones and tablets, you have just the link for the Products 
page. On the Products page, you have the image slider with 
Coca-Cola products and you can click the Read more button to 
read more about the specific product. On the third page, the 
Gifts page, you can choose your drink and you 'will get' a 
gift that goes together with that drink. You just need to 
enter the promo code(check corners of the page) and your 
email address, and after that, check your email inbox. 
Finally, on the About page, you have some small text about 
the Coca-Cola Company. 📄
## The Purpose 🤔

The purpose of building this website was to try out as 
many web tools as possible and to get familiar with CSS 
animations, JavaScript programming generally, and a little 
bit with SEO optimization. 🤗
